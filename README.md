# Example-of-Prim-s-Algorithm-with-VBA
This repository contains the Excel file with the modeling of the minimal branching tree problem originally addressed in the article by Takahashi and Yamakami (2003), in which they solved it using the fuzzy method. In this file, the problem is solved by Prim's algorithm, which was implemented in VBA, allowing to discover two solution trees for the problem in a matter of seconds. The VBA code is open for viewing.
